# Studs_Solid-Streamlit

This Streamlit application predicts the nominal and design shear resistance using optimized ML models, including gradient boosting regressor (GBR), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost).

The application is based on the models described in the following preprint: Degtyarev, V.V., Hicks, S.J., Reliability-based design shear resistance of headed studs in solid slabs predicted by machine learning models, engrXiv, 2022, https://doi.org/10.31224/2244.

## Instructions on how to use the application

1. Download the content of the repository to the local machine.
2. With Python installed, install the required packages listed in the 'requirements.txt' file.
3. Open command-line interface (cmd.exe).
4. Change to the directory on the local machine where the application was saved.
5. Type the following command: streamlit run Studs_Solid.py
6. Press Enter.
7. The application opens in a web browser tab.
8. Use sliders and radio buttons to change parameters.
